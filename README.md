### Projects
**Exercise and Health Data Project in Data Mining: <br>
There are varying factors affecting health in exercise studies such as exercise session duration and calories burned. Data-driven projects can attempt to visualize these exercise inputs to outputs through classification.  A data-driven approach is the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm that groups similar input objects and classifies new input objects. Data exploration, preprocessing, and algorithm model building is performed in Python to discover the input features affecting health measures such as Experience Level in exercise and BMI.

**Predicting Advertising Results using Linear Regression: <br>
This project analyzes advertising data to predict sales using a linear regression model. The dataset includes three feature variables—Radio, TV, and Newspaper advertising spend—with Sales as the target variable. The process begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is loaded and explored. Next, a linear regression model is trained to predict sales based on advertising spend. The model's performance is then evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy. Finally, the trained model is used to predict sales for new cases. This project demonstrates fundamental regression techniques and performance evaluation in data analysis.
